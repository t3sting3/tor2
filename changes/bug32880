  o Minor bugfixes (circuit, handshake):
    - In the v3 handshaking code, Use connection_or_change_state() to change
      the state. Previously, we changed the state directly, but this did not
      pass a state change to the pubsub or channel object. Fixes bug 32880;
      bugfix on 0.2.3.6-alpha. Patch by Neel Chauhan.

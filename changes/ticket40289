  o Minor bugfixes (relay, config):
    - Fix a problem in the removal of duplicate ORPort from the internal port
      list when loading config file. We were removing wrong ports breaking valid
      torrc uses cases for multiple ORPorts of the same address family. Fixes
      bug 40289; bugfix on 0.4.5.1-alpha.

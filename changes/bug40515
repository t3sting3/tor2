  o Minor bugfixes (controller, path bias):
    - When a circuit's path is specified, in full or in part, from the
      controller API, do not count that circuit towards our path-bias
      calculations. (Doing so was incorrect, since we cannot tell whether
      the controller is selecting relays randomly.)  Resolves a "Bug"
      warning. Fixes bug 40515; bugfix on 0.2.4.10-alpha.

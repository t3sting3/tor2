  o Minor features (geoip data):
    - We have switched geoip data sources. Previously we shipped
      IP-to-country mappings from Maxmind's GeoLite2, but in 2019 they
      changed their licensing term, so we were unable to update them after
      that point.  We now ship geoip files based on the  IPFire Location
      Database instead.  (See https://location.ipfire.org/ for more
      information).  This release updates our geoip files to match the
      IPFire Location Database as retrieved on 2021/03/12.  Closes
      ticket 40224.

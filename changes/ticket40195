  o Minor bugfixes (configuration, ports):
    - Fix an issue where an ORPort was validated against other type of ports
      when it should have been only checked against other ORPorts. This lead to
      "DirPort auto" to be ignored and failing to be used. Fixes bug 40195;
      bugfix on 0.4.5.1-alpha.

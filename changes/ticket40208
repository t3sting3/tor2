  o Minor bugfixes (relay):
    - Allow relays to have a RFC1918 address if PublishServerDescriptor is set
      to 0 and AssumeReachable is set to 1. This is to support the use case of a
      bridge on a local network that can be used by restricted users on that
      network to reach the Tor network. Fixes bug 40208; bugfix on
      0.4.5.1-alpha.

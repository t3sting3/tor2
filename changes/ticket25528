  o Minor bugfixes (client, bridge, configuration):
    - Exit tor on a misconfiguration when the Bridge line has a transport but
      no corresponding ClientTransportPlugin can be found. Prior to this fix,
      tor would attempt to connect to the bridge directly without using the
      transport leading to a possible leak on the wire. Fixes bug 25528;
      bugfix on 0.2.6.1-alpha.

  o Minor bugfixes (directory cache, performance, windows):
    - Limit the number of items in the consensus diff cache to 64 on Windows.
      We hope this will resolve an issue where Windows relay operators reported
      Tor using 100% CPU while we investigate better solutions. Fixes bug 24857;
      bugfix on 0.3.1.1-alpha.

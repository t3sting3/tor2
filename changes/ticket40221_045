  o Minor features (protocol versions):
    - Stop claiming to support the "DirCache=1" subprotocol version.
      Technically, we stopped supporting this subprotocol back in
      0.4.5.1-alpha, but we needed to wait for the authorities to stop
      listing it as "required" before we can drop support. Closes ticket
      40221.

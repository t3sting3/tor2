  o Minor features (compilation):
    - Disable deprecation warnings when building with OpenSSL 3.0.0 or later.
      There are a number of newly deprecated APIs in OpenSSL 3.0.0 that Tor
      still requires.  (A later version of Tor will try to stop depending on
      these.)  Closes ticket 40165.

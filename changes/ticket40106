  o Minor bugfixes (config, bridge):
    - Don't initiate a connection to a bridge without a corresponding
      transport. Fixes bug 40106; bugfix on 0.4.5.1-alpha.
    - This also reverts an earlier fix we did for this that would validate
      configuration to avoid such situation but turns out it wouldn't work for
      a DisableNetwork thus the new approach.
